TPOT is a Python tool that automatically creates and optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example machine learning pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce TPOT is finished searching (or you get tired of waiting), it provides you with the Python code for the best pipeline it found so you can tinker with the pipeline from there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example TPOT pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTPOT is built on top of scikit-learn, so all of the code it generates should look familiar... if you're familiar with scikit-learn, anyway.\n\n\nTPOT is still under active development\n and we encourage you to check back on this repository regularly for updates.\n\n\nLicense\n\n\nPlease see the \nrepository license\n for the licensing and usage information for TPOT.\n\n\nGenerally, we have licensed TPOT to make it as widely usable as possible.\n\n\nHaving problems or have questions about TPOT?\n\n\nPlease \ncheck the existing open and closed issues\n to see if your issue has already been attended to.

We don't recommend that you tweak this parameter unless you know what you're doing.\n\n\ncrossover_rate\n: The crossover rate for the genetic programming algorithm in the range [0.0, 1.0].

It then initializes the Genetic Algoritm to find the best pipeline based on the validation set performance evaluated on the basis of a scoring function (generally the classification accuracy, but can be user defined as well like precision/recall/f1, etc).   \n\n\nYou can then proceed to evaluate the final pipeline on the test set with the \nscore()\n function:\n\n\nfrom tpot import TPOT\n\npipeline_optimizer = TPOT(generations=100, random_state=42, verbosity=2)\npipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)\nprint(pipeline_optimizer.score(testing_features, testing_classes))\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you can tell TPOT to export the corresponding Python code for the optimized pipeline to a text file with the \nexport()\n function:\n\n\nfrom tpot import TPOT\n\npipeline_optimizer = TPOT(generations=100, random_state=42, verbosity=2)\npipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)\nprint(pipeline_optimizer.score(testing_features, testing_classes))\npipeline_optimizer.export('tpot_exported_pipeline.py')\n\n\n\n\nOnce this code finishes running, \ntpot_exported_pipeline.py\n will contain the Python code for the optimized pipeline.\n\n\nCheck our \nexamples\n to see TPOT applied to some specific data sets.\n\n\nScoring Functions\n\n\nTPOT is designed to use the two following method signatures for a scoring function \nmethod(y_true, y_pred)\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny_true\n - [n_samples] \n\n\n\n\nThe true class labels for each sample in the evaluated dataset.\n\n\n\n\ny_pred\n - [n_samples, n_classes]\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted probabilities for each class for each sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny_true\n - [n_samples]\n\n\n\n\nThe true class labels for each sample in the evaluated dataset.\n\n\n\n\ny_pred\n - [n_samples] \n\n\n\n\nThe predicted labels for each sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny_true\n - [n_samples] \n\n\n\n\nThe true class labels for each sample in the evaluated dataset.\n\n\n\n\npred_decision\n - [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes] \n\n\n\n\nThe decision score for each class for each sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is up to the user to decide whether or not the classification metric (and any keyword arguments) they use is appropriate for their purposes, as some metrics may fit in one of the above method signatures, but the returned value \nmay not be appropriate as a fitness measure (e.g., correlation).

This creates\n   a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone this copy to your local disk:\n\n\n  $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/tpot.git\n  $ cd tpot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a branch to hold your changes:\n\n\n  $ git checkout -b my-contribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your local environment is setup correctly for development. Installation instructions are almost identical to \nthe user instructions\n except that TPOT should \nnot\n be installed. If you have TPOT installed on your computer then make sure you are using a virtual environment that does not have TPOT installed. Furthermore, you should make sure you have installed the \nnose\n package into your development environment so that you can test changes locally.\n\n\n  $ conda install nose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart making changes on your newly created branch, remembering to never work on the \nmaster\n branch! Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce some changes are saved locally, you can use your tweaked version of TPOT by navigating to the project's base directory and running TPOT directly from the command line:\n\n\n  $ python -m tpot.tpot\n\n\n\nor by running script that imports and uses the TPOT module with code similar to \nfrom tpot import TPOT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check your changes haven't broken any existing tests and to check new tests you've added pass run the following (note, you must have the \nnose\n package installed within your dev environment for this to work):\n\n\n  $ nosetests -s -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're done editing and local testing, run:\n\n\n  $ git add modified_files\n  $ git commit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with:\n\n\n      $ git push -u origin my-contribution\n\n\n\nFinally, go to the web page of your fork of the TPOT repo, and click 'Pull Request' (PR) to send your changes to the maintainers for review. Make sure that you send your PR to the \ndevelopment\n branch, as the \nmaster\n branch is reserved for the latest stable release.
